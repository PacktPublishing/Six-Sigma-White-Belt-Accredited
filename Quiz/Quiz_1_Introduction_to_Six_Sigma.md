Answer 1 – What is Six Sigma?


1. Correct Answer: B. Find out where the process is failing and implement a data-driven solution
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma is about identifying inefficiencies and using data-driven methods to fix them. Finding the root cause of misplaced records and optimizing the system ensures long-term efficiency.

 Incorrect Answers:

A. Train staff to memorize patient details: This is not a scalable or reliable solution. Human memory is prone to errors.

C. Increase the number of staff: More people won’t necessarily fix the process failure. It could just increase costs.

D. Assume delays are unavoidable: Six Sigma is about reducing errors and improving processes, not accepting inefficiencies.

2. Correct Answer: B. Investigate the production process, collect data, and identify the root cause of defects
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma focuses on eliminating defects by improving the process itself rather than just catching mistakes. Identifying the cause of defects ensures long-term quality improvement.

 Incorrect Answers:

A. Reduce the number of products produced: This does not solve the quality problem, only reduces production output.

C. Hire more quality control inspectors: Inspections catch defects but do not prevent them from occurring.

D. Offer discounts on defective products: This is a short-term fix that doesn’t improve efficiency or quality.



3. Correct Answer: A. Create a standard process for taking and verifying orders before preparation
 Explanation:
 Standardizing the ordering process reduces variation and prevents mistakes before they happen—one of the key objectives of Six Sigma.

 Incorrect Answers:

B. Apologize and offer free meals: This does not fix the root cause of the problem.

C. Hire more staff: More employees won’t necessarily fix the process inefficiency.

D. Ask customers to repeat orders multiple times: While verification is good, an inefficient process will still create delays and errors.

4. Correct Answer: A. Gather data on call volume and analyze bottlenecks in the process
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma emphasizes analyzing data to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in a process. By studying the workflow, companies can optimize response times and reduce delays.

 Incorrect Answers:

B. Increase the number of customer service representatives: This may help temporarily but does not address inefficiencies in the system.

C. Shorten each call by rushing: Rushing may lead to poor service and increased complaints.

D. Assume long wait times are normal: Six Sigma seeks to improve processes, not accept inefficiencies.

5. Correct Answer: C. Reduce defects to no more than 3.4 per million opportunities
 Explanation:
 The core goal of Six Sigma is to reduce defects to an almost negligible level—3.4 defects per million opportunities.

 Incorrect Answers:

A. Inspecting only after production: This is reactive, not proactive. Six Sigma focuses on preventing defects, not just detecting them.

B. Training workers to check mistakes: This helps, but Six Sigma emphasizes designing a process that minimizes mistakes from happening in the first place.

D. Accepting defects as unavoidable: Six Sigma strives for near-perfection, meaning mistakes should be systematically reduced.

6. Correct Answer: A. To improve efficiency by reducing errors and waste
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma aims to optimize processes by eliminating errors and inefficiencies, leading to higher quality and lower costs.

 Incorrect Answers:

B. Increasing employee satisfaction: While efficiency can boost morale, this is not the primary goal.

C. Creating expensive products: Six Sigma is about process efficiency, not high-cost production.

D. Focusing only on customer service: Six Sigma applies to all business areas, not just customer service.

7. Correct Answer: A. A measure of how much a process varies
 Explanation:
 Sigma represents standard deviation in statistics, which measures process variation. Six Sigma aims to minimize this variation for consistent results.

Incorrect Answers:

B. Number of employees: Sigma is a statistical concept, not related to workforce size.

C. Money saved: Cost savings result from Six Sigma but are not what “Sigma” refers to.

D. Total defects: Sigma measures variation, not just defects.

8. Correct Answer: A. Achieve near-perfect quality with minimal defects
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma strives for 3.4 defects per million opportunities, meaning near-perfection in processes.

 Incorrect Answers:

B. Replacing employees: Automation can help, but Six Sigma is about optimizing processes, not job cuts.

C. Eliminating all business costs: Six Sigma reduces waste but does not eliminate costs entirely.

D. Focusing only on speed: Speed is important, but accuracy is equally critical.

9. Correct Answer: A. By using data to identify and fix inefficiencies
 Explanation:
 Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology that finds inefficiencies and corrects them systematically.

Incorrect Answers:

B. Increasing profits without changes: Profits improve through process improvements, not automatically.

C. Temporary solutions: Six Sigma aims for long-term solutions.

D. Only managers making decisions: Six Sigma involves all employees in process improvement.
